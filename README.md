# Neural Networks Class Classification

## Overview

This Python repository contains code for classifying Dry beans into three categories (Bomay, Cali, and Sira) using single-layer perceptron and adaline neural network models. The dataset consists of 50 samples from each category, with five features measured for each sample: Area, Perimeter, MajorAxisLength, MinorAxisLength, and roundness (in millimeters).

In addition to the neural network models, the repository also includes code for sentiment analysis on an Arabic review dataset. This dataset contains two columns: `review_description` and `rating`. The `review_description` represents the Arabic sentence, and the `rating` is the predicted sentiment analysis, taking one of the following values: 1, 0, -1. The sentiment analysis is performed using a transformer and a bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM).
